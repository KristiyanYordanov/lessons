<p><i>What comes to mind when you hear “Marsala”? Do you think of chicken? Perhaps if you’re a movie buff like me you may think of Ben Hur…no, wait…that was Messala.</i></p>
<br/>

<p style="color:#955251">Nope, I'm not talking about chickens or generals today. You may already have some Marsala in your life and not even realize it. It could be in your shoes, your shirt, your bedroom, kitchen, or studio. While I was gathering clips and info for this article I think I even saw it in a truck commercial.</p>

<p><i>Marsala is everywhere—but what is it?</i></p>

<p style="color:#955251">Each year, researchers and analysts at the <a href="http://www.pantone.com">Pantone Color Institute</a> comb a variety of industries—spanning fashion, beauty, science, entertainment, fine art, and travel—looking for and forecasting future color trends.</p>

<p><i>"Much like the fortified wine that gives Marsala its name, this tasteful hue embodies the satisfying richness of a fulfilling meal, while its grounding red-brown roots emanate a sophisticated, natural earthiness," says Pantone Color Institute executive director Leatrice Eiseman. "This hearty yet stylish tone is universally appealing and translates easily to fashion, beauty, industrial design, home furnishings, and interiors."</i></p>
